<h1><strong>Born in Tokyo. Raised in Austin. Based in Chicago.</strong></h1>

Growing up in multiple cultures has given me a unique kind of perspective and a deep appreciation for new and different ones. This is why I enjoy being a designer — constant learning, exploring and experimenting to create new ways of experiencing things.

I’m passionate about the intersection of design and business. I love to solve problems with others, for others (and if it’s for the greater good, that’s even better). I lead by example, with empathy, curiosity, transparency and trust.

When I’m not working, you’ll find me channeling my creativity and energy into my other passions — cooking, baking, [eating], gardening, crafting, and exploring nearby forest preserves with my family and rescue pup.
